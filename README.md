<h3>Passion</h3>
<p>
Growing up having a hard time not believing in much, including myself.
Being told that I would not make it far in elementry school and that I should be placed in special eudicatinal classes while
attending a public school, My aunt thought it would be best for me to approach eudication from a catholic's aspect. Placed in regular classes with
with regular students, exhaling at the same pace as others has always made me passinate about helping Making Chicago Public Schools a better place for all youth to have the 
a equal oppuritunity at learning also proper eudication for all. My family is the reason behind my driving force behind his ambition to go somewhere far in life.
He enjoys helping others, a wonderful team-player, someone who loves taking on new challenges, starting things and making sure to complete them. Fabian enjoys coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Fabian.
